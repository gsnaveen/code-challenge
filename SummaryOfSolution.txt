CONSTRAINT: You will define an in-memory data structure

Due the above contraint Hash of Hashes was used similar to a document database, but in memory. From solely  analytics prespective RDBMS will be a good option.

PERFORMANCE - what the performance characteristic of the code is and how it could be improved in the future.

This process executes sequentially and is limited to the memory of the machine. Have pre computed some of the metrics which is good for the SUMMARY of a USER or to compute AGGREGATED metircs for all the activity of a user. This speeds up the specific usecase. Since all other data is in the Data Structure we can do other analytics on it. 

For SCALING this solution:

DataStore can be a NoSQL as it speeds up individual transactions and can be parallel
(if using hadoop Hbase can be used as a external source for a Hive table. this gives advantage of NoSQL for transaction and provided RDBMS structure for analytics)
Every event can be it's own entity/Store
Some of the other additive metrix can be pre computed at the time of ETL
SPARK SQL can be used to pull this data into memory and execute analytics on it.
