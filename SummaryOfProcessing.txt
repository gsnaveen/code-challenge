Language : Python 
version	 : 3.6.2
Execution : pyhton cltv.py
			python cltv_test.py
Libraries used 
	processing 	: json (For reading the data)
				  datetime (date computation)
				  heapq (for keeping top X  LTV values)
	testing		: unittest

Events with the following are considered for computation of LTV:
        # If orders > 0
        # If order amount > 0 , It is possible that a order was cancelled so order amount can end up being Zero 
        # Customer information , we need to have a valid joinDate which should be in the range of min and max of the date in the dataset 
        # Visits > 0
		# joinDate needs to be >= Mindate of dataset and <= MaxDate of the dataset
        # as these elemets are required for computing Customer LTV

Week: For computation purpose week = 7 days.  (MaxDate - Customer joinDate)/7

Add/Update: Event Date is used for driving add or update to the dataset 

Computed attributes:
		MaxDate: Max date in the dataset
		MinDate: Min date in the dataset
		
		Per Customer:
			order_count: Number of the orders
			total_amount: Total amount for the orders placed
			SITE_VISIT count: Number of visit events recieved
			IMAGE count		: Number of IMAGE events recieved
Data Exceptions:
		No expection handeling is done for Key and EventTime as these attributes are guaranteed
		if type is not matched then print: Data not mapped! with data
		customer_id != ""
		Order total amount needs to be valid
		
test Cases:
		Insert else update for the customer information
		updates to  total_amount as per the order data sequence
		(there can be lot more)
		Manually validate for TopX if x = 10 there are 2 customeriD's in the out file and if x = 1 then there is only 1 cutomerID in the out file.
